<span class='inline-group'><strong>WHEREAS</strong> , the Seller desires to sell to the Institution a comprehensive collection of <strong>19th century American folk art</strong> ("Collection"), which is more particularly described in the attached inventory, Attachment A, which is incorporated herein by reference; and,</span>
<span class='inline-group'><strong>WHEREAS</strong> , the Institution deems it in its interest to acquire the Collection for custodial care and appropriate service to the public, and is agreeable to purchasing the Collection under the terms hereafter stated;</span>

The Institution will indicate its acceptance or rejection of the Collection in writing. The Institution will reduce payment by $ <strong>500</strong> per rejected or missing item, or may, at the Institution's discretion, accept as replacements different items from the Seller.</span>

This indemnification binds the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of the Seller.</p>
<strong><p>5. Publicity</p></strong>

<strong><p>b) Severability</p></strong>
<p>If any particular term, covenant, or provision of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceability thereof will not affect the remaining provisions of this agreement, which will nevertheless remain in full force and effect.</p>
